        <img src="images/lp live in texas.jpg" alt="Live in Texas" width="300px">
        <p>Live in Texas is the first live album and third DVD by American nu-metal band Linkin Park, originally released on November 18, 2003. The band's main setlist includes songs from their studio albums Hybrid Theory and Meteora, as well as one song from their remix album Reanimation. The live album peaked at #23 on the Billboard 200, and it has sold 1.1 million copies in the United States.[1] The audio version of the concert includes 12 out of the 17 tracks. At the end of "A Place for My Head", lead singer Chester Bennington breaks guitarist Brad Delson's guitar. At the end of the concert, DJ Joe Hahn threw a piece of his equipment on the stage floor.</p>

        <p>2# Hybrid Theory (2000)</p>
        <br>
        <img src="images/lp hybrid theory.jpg" alt="Hybrid Theory" width="300px">
        <p>Hybrid Theory is the debut studio album by American nu-metal band Linkin Park, released on October 24, 2000, through Warner Bros. Records. Recorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don Gilmore, the album's lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and divorce of his parents. Hybrid Theory takes its title from the previous name of the band as well as the concept of music theory and combining different styles. This is also the only album on which bassist Dave Farrell does not play.</p>

        <p>1# Meteora (2003)</p>
        <br>
        <img src="images/lp - meteora.jpg" alt="Meteora" width="300px">
        <p>Meteora is the second studio album by American nu-metal band Linkin Park. It was released on March 25, 2003, through Warner Bros. Records, following Reanimation, a collaboration album which featured remixes of songs included on their 2000 debut studio album Hybrid Theory. The album was produced by the band alongside Don Gilmore. The title Meteora is taken from the Greek Orthodox monasteries originally bearing the name.[1] Meteora has a similar sound to Hybrid Theory, as described by critics, and the album took almost a year to be recorded. It is the first Linkin Park studio album to feature bassist Dave Farrell after he rejoined the band in 2000 following his temporary touring with other bands.</p>
